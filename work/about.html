	<h1> Know about Pizza</h1>
	
	<p>
		Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a
		usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various 
		other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.),
		which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] 
		A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

	<p>
		In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] 
		In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.

	<h2> When the term pizza was first recorded?</h2>
	<p>
		The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript
		from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[4] Modern pizza 
		was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries.[5] 
		It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe, North 
		America and Australasia; available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering 
		Mediterranean cuisine, via pizza delivery, and as street food.[5] Various food companies sell ready-baked pizzas, 
		which may be frozen, in grocery stores, to be reheated in a home oven.
